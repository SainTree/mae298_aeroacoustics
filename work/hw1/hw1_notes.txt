#QUESTIONS
do we have to play sound in code?
is pascal/volts conversion correct?
    yes
    ~0.56V
Use source frequency 44100 from Matlab example or 48000 from .wav data?
    48000 is ok
is given pressure P or Prms?

#1.1
what are the higher freq peaks in power spectrum? reflections off mountains?

#1.2
is peak of power on right order?
    No
extend frequency axis beyond 50Hz?
    yes, 10kHz
what is y ax units for power spec?
    Power spectrum density Pa^2/HZ
#1.3
SPL vs time or freq?
    vs freq, time doesn't mean much
#2
if center frequency band is out of range of original data, do we include it?
    No

#ADD TO CODE:
Add atmospheric pressure isobar to pressure N-wave plot
add text box with N-wave duration time to pressure wave plot

add text boox with reference pressure to SPL plot

#SOUND READING ISSUES
scipy does not read in normalized sound like matlab
scipy and soundfile return same data after normalization
