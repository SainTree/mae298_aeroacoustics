why is omega from rpm a function of number of blades?
    each blade is a source so more blades means observer hears more sources in a single rotation
ignoring downstream propagation, so we dont need to calc Kz-, just Kz+?
    real part is direction of propegation
    imaginary part is decaying or expanding exponential
Only one cut-on mode for upstream propagation?
    yes
